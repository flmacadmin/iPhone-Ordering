# iPhone Ordering

A Tkinter GUI that displays menu selections for iPhones.

## Use

At Jamf, staff use this script to select iPhones for IT to purchase on the corporate wireless account. Our version of this script generates a Service Desk ticket from the collected options using a service account's credentials passed as parameters in the Self Service policy *($4 and $5 respectively)*.

If you wish to use this script within your organization you may copy the contents and customize it to work in your environment following the guide below.

> **This script has no external dependencies and has been tested on macOS 10.10+.**

## Customization

The object `MODEL_OPTIONS` defines the contents of the GUI when it loads.

For each `model` of iPhone you can define the `color` and `storage size` options that are available in the drop-downs. Each model in this object will be a menu option in the GUI that will update the color and storage menus when selected.

> *The URLs currently in the script that link to Dropbox are not guaranteed to work - you are encouraged to use your own hosting options for these images!*

The following syntax shows how to define each model.

```pyton
{
    '<model name>': {
        'storage': [16],  # Array of integers for allowed sizes
        'colors': {
            '<color name>': {
                'image_url': 'https://url_to_image.gif'
            }
        }
     }
}
```

Multiple `colors` can be defined for each `model`. Each `color` needs an image available at a reachable URL to load. The images must meet the following specifications:

* GIF Format (Tkinter only supports this format by default)
* 300 Ã— 355 pixels
* Background color #F0F0F0 (Tkinter does not render transparency)

Below `MODEL_OPTIONS` there is a `create_ticket()` function where you will write the code to handle passing the user's selections into your ticketing system. The following data will be available to generate the ticket's contents from:

* `request_type`
* `model_name`
* `model_color`
* `model_storage`

A global variable named `LOGGED_IN_USER` is available to obtain the username of who is running the script. When run from Self Service, this variable can be one of two values:

1. Self Service requires authentication - it will be the authenticated username, or
2. Self Service does not require authentication - it will be the username of the local Mac user account.

## Testing

To run this script locally, type the path to the system's Python interpreter and **pass three values after the filename** to fill in the needed parameters *(the script uses $3 to obtain the username)*:

```
~$ /usr/bin/python iPhone-Ordering.py 1 2 username
```

The script will log the user's actions in the GUI as it runs and print the selected information at the end:
